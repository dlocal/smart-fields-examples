[See them in action!](https://dlocal.github.io/smart-fields-examples/)

This repository contains examples of stylish forms that use SmartFields. These examples illustrate how to handle errors in real-time and style focus states, error states, and placeholders.

Common code for handling errors and form submission lives [here](js/index.js).

## Example 1

- [JavaScript](js/example-1.js)
- [CSS](css/example-1.css)

Example 1 is the simpliest example that shows a form that uses the `card` SmartField.

## Example 2

- [JavaScript](js/example-2.js)
- [CSS](css/example-2.css)

Example 2 shows a form that collects more data and sends it when it creates the token.

## Example 3

- [JavaScript](js/example-3.js)
- [CSS](css/example-3.css)

Example 3 shows a form that uses individual `pan`, `expiration`, and `cvv` SmartFields with a custom web font and custom placeholders.

The form also collects other data outside of the payment form.

## Example 4

- [JavaScript](js/example-4.js)
- [CSS](css/example-4.css)

Example 4 shows a form that displays the abailable installments for the example amount and uses the `card` SmartField. This example does not show the brand icon flag.

## Example 5

- [JavaScript](js/example-5.js)
- [CSS](css/example-5.css)

Example 5 shows a form that displays the abailable installments for the example amount and uses `pan`, `expiration`, and `cvv` SmartFields with floating labels and custom placeholders.

## Example 6

- [JavaScript](js/example-6.js)
- [CSS](css/example-6.css)

Example 6 shows a form that uses individual `number`, `expiration`, and `cvv` fields, styled with floating labels, and many other features thar show the power of Smart-Fields to be styled as you need in your site.
