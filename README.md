# Smart-Fields-examples

[See them in action!](https://dlocal.github.io/smart-fields-examples/)

This repository contains examples of stylish forms that use Stripe Elements. These examples illustrate how to handle errors in real-time and style focus states, error states, and placeholders.

Common code for handling errors and form submission lives [here](js/index.js).

## Example 1

- [JavaScript](js/example-1.js)
- [CSS](css/example-1.css)

Example 1 is the simpliest example that shows a form that uses the `card` Smart-Field.

<!-- ## Example 2

- [JavaScript](js/example-2.js)
- [CSS](css/example-2.css)

Example 2 shows a "floaty-label" form that uses individual `cardNumber`, `cardExpiry`, and `cardCvc` Elements with a custom web font.

The form also collects address (and thus postal code) outside of the payment form. It passes the postal code to Stripe on tokenization.

## Example 3

- [JavaScript](js/example-3.js)
- [CSS](css/example-3.css)

Example 3 shows a form that uses individual `cardNumber`, `cardExpiry`, and `cardCvc` Elements with a custom web font.

The form also collects postal code outside of the payment form.

## Example 4

- [JavaScript](js/example-4.js)
- [CSS](css/example-4.css)

Example 4 shows a form that uses the `paymentRequestButton` Element to provide
Apple Pay / Payment Request API support, as well as a `card` Element with a
custom web font.

## Example 5

- [JavaScript](js/example-5.js)
- [CSS](css/example-5.css)

Example 5 shows a form that uses the `paymentRequestButton` Element to provide
Apple Pay / Payment Request API support, as well as a `card` Element with a
custom icon color. -->

## Example 6

- [JavaScript](js/example-6.js)
- [CSS](css/example-6.css)

Example 6 shows a form that uses individual `number`, `expiration`, and `cvv` fields, styled with floating labels, and many other features thar show the power of Smart-Fields to be styled as you need in your site.
